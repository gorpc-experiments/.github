This group of repository is an experiment based on the basic Golang RPC example https://pkg.go.dev/net/rpc and an attempt at going further by splitting "Multiply" and "Divide" in two separate microservices with a microservice RPC discovery called Galaxy that will help search and call for the correct microservice.

This "project" is a way to test microservices interactions through RPC and Kubernetes in a live environment in order to test the feasibilty of a real use project
